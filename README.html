SimCity-Alerts.js

What the fuck? This is just a retarded modal that is meant to emulate the little advisor window that comes up in SimCity for Super Nintendo (1992). I have no idea why I made this.

To use, include the JS file and the CSS file on your page. Then on the element you want to trigger the modal, include data-role="simcity" along with a data-title and data-message attribute to fill in the modal text.

Coming soon: all the other advisor modes like warning and danger/disaster :)
